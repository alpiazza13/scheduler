# scheduler
Takes in an excel spreadsheet with time/day info on any number of classes and returns the possible schedules that can be made from those classes. Currently just a command line implementation. Allows user to input how many classes they'd like to take and any amount of restrictions which can be based on any column in their spreadsheet. Included in this repository are two example spreadsheets of classes.
